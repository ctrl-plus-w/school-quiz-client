# School Quiz Project

School Quiz is a project I made a while ago. The goal of this web app is to provide my high school a tool to test their students. The main power of this application is that while the students are working on their tests, you can enable a option to get warned when a user leave the page (e.g. make a research over google) and you get these warning in live on the professor page.  
As I said, this I one of my first project. I know many things could be refactored and enhanced however I worked so long on it that I got bored and moved on other projects.

## Stack

This application is the second one I made, the first one using ReactJS and Javascript, I decided to step up and use NextJS which is based on ReactJS and Typescript. I am also using tailwindcss as a styling library, redux to manage the states and axios to make the requests. On another hand, for the server, I made a CRUD api using express. For the database, I used Sequelize as an ORM combined with MariaDB or MySQL depending on the OS I was working on. I used JOI for te validation and SocketIO for the live part of the "warning system".
